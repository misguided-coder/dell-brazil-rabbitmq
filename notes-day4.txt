Scalability (UP/OUT/DOWN)

4 broker instances either running locally or on different machines.

cluster of brokers (Clustering)
	for 2 reasons
		Load Balancing (HA)
		Fail Over (HA)

Sender/Receiver --- this cluster will behave like just one single node

Client SLA --- No matter what messaging application must be up and 	       running 100%.

Clustering Policies

Diffrerent-Diffrerent varities of scenerios while doing testing of 
clustered brokers.

Scenerio 1) Whether cluster was highly availbale or not???
Scenerio 2) Sender sending to node 1 and receiver receiving from 
	    node 2 (LB)
Scenerio 3) Sender sending to node 1 and receiver receiving from 
	    node 2 while node 1 was down (FailOver)
Scenerio 4) One of the node in the cluster is already down and 
	    senders are sending messages to other nodes.
            When already down node will come up whether 
	    it will be in sync or not????
Scenerio 5) If number of members in cluster are 20 so not advisable
            to choose HA-MODE=all. 
	    Better is to go for primary and secondary group.


Same Physical Machine/Hardware

IP/Host will be same
Port has to be different
AMQP --- 5672 used by the broker
HTTP --- 15672 used by the UI dashboard

RabbitMQ broker has a name which is by default "rabbit" --- Node Name
Change Node Name also

Cluster having 20 nodes

	Primary group - 3 nodes
	Secondry group - 17 nodes

In any case , is there a chance that entire cluster is down 
means each node is down????

Forming a cluster does not mean that your application 
is highly available (HA).
